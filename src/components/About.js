      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing an MCA (Master of Computer Applications) degree, with a keen interest in several areas: </p>

   <h3> Full-Stack Web Development: </h3> <p>You enjoy working on both the frontend and backend aspects of web applications, which involves using technologies like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React.js for frontend development, and Node.js and Express.js for backend development.</p>

   <h3> Java Programming :</h3> You have a focus on Java programming, which is widely used in enterprise-level applications, Android development, and backend services due to its robustness, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility.

   <h3>DSA  (Data Structures and Algorithms):</h3> You're engaged in studying data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to efficient problem-solving and are crucial in software development and technical interviews.

   These interests reflect a strong foundation in software development and a desire to explore and deepen your skills in these areas.
